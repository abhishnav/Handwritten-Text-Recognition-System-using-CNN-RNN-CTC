# Handwritten-Text-Recognition-System-using-CNN-RNN-CTC

This project presents a "Handwritten Text Recognition System" that leverages Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), and Word-Beam-Search decoding to accurately recognize handwritten text. The Character Region Awareness For Text detection (CRAFT) model is used for segmentation of input paragraph text images into multiple single-line text images, facilitating focused and efficient processing. The CNN is employed for feature extraction from these segmented images, capturing spatial hierarchies in the data. These features are then processed by the LSTM-based RNN to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in the handwritten text. The CTC layer aligns the predicted text with the input image, allowing the model to handle varying lengths of text and deal with the absence of predefined character boundaries. Finally, Word Beam Search decoding improves the accuracy by considering word-level context during prediction. The system is trained and evaluated using the IAM Dataset, a widely used bench mark in the field of handwritten text recognition, which provides a diverse set of handwritten text images andcorrespondinggroundtruthannotations. The combination of these advanced techniques enables the system to achieve robust performance in recognizing handwritten text, making it suitable for applications such as digitizing handwritten documents, processing forms and auto-correction of answer sheets.
